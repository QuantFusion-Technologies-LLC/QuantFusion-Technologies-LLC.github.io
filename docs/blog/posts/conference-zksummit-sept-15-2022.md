## Networking
I had a wonderful time and mostly hung out with members of Least Authority. I also met a couple cryptographic researchers. Though many Web3 companies are fully remote, many developers have moved to Berlin and Tel Aviv. I might regularly visit these cities to collaborate with other developers and researchers. Berlin is cold but overall warmer than New York. It reminds me of California in the winter but slightly more cold.
