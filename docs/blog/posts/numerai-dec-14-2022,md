# Overview

> The Numerai Tournament is where you build machine learning models on abstract financial data to predict the stock market. 
> Numerai Signals lets you upload stock market signals and find out how original they are compared to all other signals on Numerai. Signals can be staked with the NMR cryptocurrency to earn rewards. The best most original signals are used in Numerai's hedge fund.

## Curiosity
While I think that the idea of a crowdsourced hedge fund is cool, I do not like that participants in Numerai take on a lot more risk than the hedge fund, which at this point in time is centralized. On the other hand, participants could stop and do something else with their time. I have a lot of hobbies but yet I find myself intrigued by data science in this scale. 

## Next
I will continue to participate in the main Numerai Tournament (only competed in one round previously) and start to participate in the Signals Tournament. 

## Advice
I do find these types of activities to be somewhat addicting and spend at least 40 hours/week on a laptop, so I will continue to regularly attend hobbies outside of my apartment (still working from home after temporarily trying coworking).
