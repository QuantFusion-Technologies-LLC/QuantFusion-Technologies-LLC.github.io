# HDDA + Simulation

I have missed math, so I am taking Topics on High-Dimensional Data Analytics (HDDA) and Simulation and Modeling for Engineering and Science (Simulation) this semester (Spring 2023).

## HDDA
THis class has been a great review of image processing and partial differential equations. The videos are very well organized and the TA team is dedicated to answering questions. There are so many office hours to attend and better understand the material. I hope to apply the techniques as I learn them.

## Simulation
This is my favorite class since the professor is funny and the problems are concise but effective. This has been a great opportunity to review Statistics and Numerical Analysis. My understanding has become so much better than in undergrad. I was a good student but sat in the back of the room with my friends during Statistics class and listened to the TA while also looking at used cars for sale on Craigslist.

## Advice
Time management has become so important since I have many hobbies, like hanging out with friends, and work full-time. I tend to use post-it notes a lot, attend office hours in a preventative manner, and try to provide my own distractions. Sometimes I will split my laptop screen into four cells with two being course-related, one being a movie or tv, and the other being a game. Usually, I will only do this when I have a lot of pages to read. I have worked ahead during some of my down time, so I currently have time to challenge myself to do my next HDDA assignment on Image Processing in C++. In undergrad, I did similar problems with Matlab. To not burn out, I focus on a few tasks for the day, am organized (especially for job tasks), vary my work location, and listen to my body. Sometimes, I just need to sleep and regroup the next day or change tasks.
