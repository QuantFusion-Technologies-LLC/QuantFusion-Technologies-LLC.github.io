## Networking
I met a lot of wonderful individuals. Most work as protocol engineers or software developers who switched to Web3 within the last few years. A lot are fans of Rust. :heart: Most of the people I met worked with K-Factory (in Centrifudge). I had my picture taken for an article and met someone native to Portugal. He recommended Porto for remote tech workers due to friendly digital nomad policies. In general, Portugal seems warmer than New York in the Winter but is slightly warmer than Berlin. Apparently, the weather is similar to the UK but climate change and forest fires have contributed to warmer weather. I probably will consider exploring Porto in the future.
