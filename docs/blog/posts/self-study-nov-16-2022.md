# Hello world!

Outside of work, I am self-studying MIT's CS 6.824 Distributed Systems and Network Science by Albert-László Barabási. In addition, I have found Cornell's CS 5220 Applications of Parallel Computers (taught by Professor David Bindel) to be very helpful.

## Why?
I love being challenged in fun and enriching ways. For example, I play a variety of competitive sports on a regular basis. I have stumbled upon Distributed Systems and Network Science and would love to challenge myself to find use cases for analyzing security data or improving the various static analysis tools I use.

## Next
I hope to review and learn new numerical methods for analysis. In addition, I would like to dive into Robotics, low-latency development, and coding for embedded systems. As always, this might be subject to change but I welcome change.
